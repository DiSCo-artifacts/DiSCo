In `approve` function, I used `.call()` function to transfer ether to a payable address `_address`. I've also added conditions to check if the balance of `_address` is equal to `_value` and `_value` is greater than 0 before updating the balance and transferring ether. In `request` function, I've added conditions to check if the balance of `_address` is 0, `_address` is not zero address or the contract's address and `_value` is greater than 0 before updating the balance. All these conditions are checked to ensure the security of the contract.",

The `closeCrowdsale()` function is used by the beneficiary to close the crowdsale. The `shiftSalePurchase()` function is used to purchase tokens and update the state variables. The `safeWithdrawal()` function is used to withdraw funds after the crowdsale has closed and the deadline has passed. Please replace the `tokenreward` address with the actual token contract address.",

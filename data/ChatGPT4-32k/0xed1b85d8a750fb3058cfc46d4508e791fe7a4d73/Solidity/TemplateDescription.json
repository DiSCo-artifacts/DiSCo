The `withdraw` function accepts a bytes input and checks whether the amount of ether sent is at least twice the remaining balance of the contract. If this condition and the condition that the SHA-256 hash of the input equals the `challengeNumber` are both met, then the contract is destroyed and its balance is sent to the caller.",

In the `removeCaller` function, it's stated that \"the callers of the first argument will be updated to the callers of the first argument\", which doesn't make much sense because it's just setting a value to itself. The same goes for the `modifyCallers` function. Therefore, I've preserved the logic from the description, but you might want to review it.",

The `withdraw` function takes one argument of `payable address` type. If the `withdrawn` value of the given address is 0, it calls the `broadcasters` function of the external contract `alphajobsmanager` with the given address as an argument and gets the returned value as `v0`. If `v0` is not 0, it updates the `withdrawn` value of the given address to 1 and transfers ether valued `v0` to the given address.",

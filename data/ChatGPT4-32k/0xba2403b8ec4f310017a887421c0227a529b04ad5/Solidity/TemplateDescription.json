This function is `external` and `payable`, meaning it can accept Ether and be called from other contracts. It adds the sent value (msg.value) to the caller's balance.\n\nThe `withdraw` function checks the current timestamp and the balance of the caller. If the conditions are met, it transfers the caller's balance to the caller's address and then sets the balance to 0. \n\nThe `receive` function is a special fallback function introduced in Solidity 0.6.0 that is executed when the contract receives plain Ether (without data). This function updates the balance of the caller with the received Ether.\n\nA few security measures are also implemented. `require` statements are used to ensure that the sender's address is not zero and there are sufficient funds before making a transfer. The success of the Ether transfer is also checked.",
